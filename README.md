#  FB13119509: Inspector does not work with DismissAction from environment


## Scenario

A view is presented as `.inspector(isPresented:content:)`. Inside of the Inspector is a button to close the inspector.


## Issue

The close button should be able to use the `dismissAction` provided via `@Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss` to end the presentation of the inspector. It should work for both presentations: As side-panel on wider screens and sheet on narrow screens.

It should work the same way as when using `.sheet(isPresented:content:)`.

(Interesting side note: Other sheet related modifier do work as expected on the .inspector view, when it is displayed as a sheet.)


### Other View Modifier

 - 游릴 .presentationDetents()
 - 游릴 .presentationBackgroundInteraction()
 - 游릴 .presentationCornerRadius()
 - 游릴 .presentationDragIndicator()
 - 游린 .presentationBackground()


## Example Code

The example shows two toggles to present an .inspector or .sheet view. Both show the same content: A close button using the dismissAction. 

Behavior: The .sheet can be dismissed, the .inspector can not.

Expected: Both presentation modes should be dismissed the same way.
